# Contributing

We welcome all contributions to this project! If you notice a bug, or have a feature request, please open up an issue here. If youâ€™d like to contribute a feature or bug fix, you can fork our repo and submit a pull request. We will review pull requests within 7 days. All contributors must abide by our code of conduct.

Core Contributors/Collaborators with write access should open a branch when working with any code files. Once the branch work is complete, pull requests require review and approval by at least one other major contributor. Minor text only changes (such as to .md documentation in the repo root) can be done safely in main.
